VRPipe::Pipeline - describes a pipeline (a series of steps)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

*** more documentation to come

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A Pipeline C<has_many> L<VRPipe::StepMember>s. It also has a name and
description. It also has associated objects that define how data flows in and
out of its component steps, and has behaviours for what should happen after
steps finish. Pipeline has a key place in the object model, being one of the
main objects users are likely to think about. Users want to "run a pipeline" on
their data. The pipelines that they can run are defined by these objects. A
Pipeline doesn't actually "do" anything, it just defines what is supposed to
happen and in what order.

It is possible to create a pipeline on the fly by C<create()>ing one of these
objects (suppling a new unique name), and then associating existing or new
StepMembers, StepAdaptors and StepBehvaiours. This is how the
B<vrpipe-create_pipeline> frontend lets users create their own pipelines.

Normally, however, you would define a Pipeline in a .pm file as
C<VRPipe::Pipelines::[your_pipeline_name]>. Special tricks automatically
convert these into VRPipe::Pipeline (and associated) objects in the database.

You must be wary, however, that the tricks cannot cope with the order of steps
changing, steps being removed or inserted. Only adding an extra step on the end
of a pipeline is safe. The advice is, test and stabilise a Pipeline, and once
it is in production never change it. If it turns out there are changes to steps
that have to be made, stop using that pipeline and create a new one with a
different name.
